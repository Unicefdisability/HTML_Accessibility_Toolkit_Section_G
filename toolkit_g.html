				<span>Part 1: Using the accessibility checklists</span>
			</h1>
			<p id="id_115">
				<span>The following checklists consist of a description followed by a list of important items to check, although some items might not be available or relevant in every context.</span>
			</p>
			<p id="id_116">
				<span>The checklists are grouped into four main areas, following the RECU steps:</span>
			</p>
			<ul id="id_117">
				<li id="id_118">
					<span>
						<strong id="id_119">Checklists 1–3: Reaching the facility</strong> (vehicles, parking, external pathways)</span>
				</li>
				<li id="id_120">
					<span>
						<strong id="id_121">Checklists 4–6: Entering the facility</strong> (security booths, ramps, reception areas)</span>
				</li>
				<li id="id_122">
					<span>
						<strong id="id_123">Checklists 7–10: Circulating around the facility</strong> (doorways, stairs, elevators, corridors)</span>
				</li>
				<li id="id_124">
					<span>
						<strong id="id_125">Checklists 11–17: Using specific areas</strong> (typical equipment, toilets, meeting rooms, kitchens, living spaces, water access points, playgrounds)</span>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p id="id_126">
				<span>Depending on the complexity of the building to assess and the level of detail required by the assessment, the same checklist can be used for various similar spaces; for example, if more than one toilet/door/corridor/staircase/ramp, etc., needs to be assessed, various checklists must be completed for each space. In this case, it is necessary to print more than one copy of each checklist so they are available during the site visit.</span>

			<p id="id_127">
				<span class="normalized" id="id_128">
					<span>While millimetres are used in the checklists, the standards can be converted into another measuring system using an online conversion platform, such as </span>

					<span>Limitations: What is not covered in the checklists</span>
				</strong>
			</p>
			<p id="id_137">
				<span>While the checklists concern many building areas that need to be assessed in terms of accessibility, they do not capture every possible situation. The checklists should be considered as a reference to support and inform accessibility assessments; they are not and cannot be exhaustive. The following areas, for example, are not covered:</span>
			</p>
			<ul id="id_138">
				<li id="id_139">
					<span class="normalized" id="id_140">
						<span>
							<strong id="id_141">Furniture/equipment –</strong>Some consideration is given to furniture and equipment that might affect accessibility, but it is not comprehensive. Persons with disabilities who are already using certain facilities will ideally also be engaged to consider individual preferences and requirements. Where possible, flexible furniture like height adjustable tables and chairs with wheels that lock should be used to promote both safety and flexibility. </span>
					</span>
					<a href="#c001" class="footnote" id="noteref_1">1</a>
				</li>
				<li id="id_142">
					<span>
						<strong id="id_143">Historic sites –</strong> Standards in many countries relate to making buildings and sites of historic significance accessible. These guides take into account both accessibility and respect for the integrity of the historic site. International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards provide technical guidance that can be applied in every context, including historic sites. The standards are ‘absolute’, however, and  it is the responsibility of architects/designers to use them in an appropriate and contextualized way. In some particularly sensitive cases in terms of safeguarding the architectural patrimony, temporary and mobile accessibility solutions can be envisaged.</span>
				</li>
				<li id="id_144">
					<span>
						<strong id="id_145">Informal settlements –</strong> Informal/emergency settlements, and slums in particular, may have additional constraints, including the lack of available materials. Nevertheless, many of the accessibility principles (the width of pathways, the slope of ramps, etc.) remain applicable. In certain cases, portable or demountable solutions can be used, such as handrails that can be easily disassembled and moved to another house/ location.</span>
				</li>
				<li id="id_146">
					<span id="id_147" class="normalized">
						<span>
							<strong id="id_148">Digital supports and tools –</strong>While the accessibility of information and  communication technology is extremely important (for example, adding alt text to photos and graphics to describe an image for a person who is using a screen-reader), this area falls beyond the scope of this toolkit. </span>

				<ul id="id_163">
					<li id="id_164">
						<span>The most common <strong id="id_165">mode of public transportation, </strong> especially in low- or medium- income countries, is the bus. Persons with disabilities should be able to reach a bus stop easily; it should be on an even, hard and flat surface (a), without confronting steps or uneven ground (sand, grass, mud, gravel, etc.). A sheltered waiting area (b) should be available, large enough to accommodate persons using a wheelchair. Bus stops should provide clear and accessible information about the name of the stop, the buses stopping there, timetables, service disruptions, etc. An accessible ticket machine (c) should be available at the bus stop; it should be easy to identify by persons who are blind and to use by all. A bus stop on a raised platform should be equipped with an appropriate kerb cut or ramp (d). Entering the bus should be easy for everyone, and ideally buses should have a low floor at the level of the bus stop pavement, with no steps. If the bus is higher, or if there is a gap between the bus and the bus stop pavement, a movable ramp should be provided (e) and operated automatically or by the bus driver.</span>
					</li>
					<li id="id_166">
						<span>Enough internal space should be allowed for persons using a wheelchair to manoeuvre, and this space should allow good visibility of any information provided and reaching the stop button, the alarm bell and interphone, etc. (f). Belts should be available to secure the wheelchair while traveling. Bus drivers should have basic knowledge about how to secure a wheelchair and provide necessary support.</span>
					</li>
					<li id="id_167">
						<span>Information inside the bus on the upcoming stop, the actual stop, the bus route and number, etc., should be provided in multiple formats (at least in visual and audio formats).</span>
					</li>
					<li id="id_168">
						<span>The most common <strong id="id_169">individual mode of transportation</strong> is the car, minivan, tuk- tuks, etc. They should be equipped with a roll-in system (with a back or lateral ramp and enough internal space to accommodate persons using a wheelchair) (g). Alternatively, they should allow independent transfer from a wheelchair to the interior seats and provide enough space to accommodate a folded wheelchair.</span>

						<span>Playgrounds need to ensure that the RECU steps are implemented and accessible to all, including children with disabilities as well as parents with disabilities.</span>
					</li>
					<li id="id_2484">
						<span>Playgrounds must be easy to reach from a main road and be far from potential hazards (a river, steep hill, etc.). The surface around and under the equipment (a) should be flat and even, with no holes or obstacles, made of firm material (no sand, grass or gravel) and possibly shock-absorbing. The playground equipment should be connected by large, flat and even circulation pathways (b), with no separations such as raised kerbs, decorative borders, steps, etc.</span>
					</li>
					<li id="id_2485">
						<span class="normalized" id="id_2486">
							<span>Accessible water fountains (c) should be available and at least one accessible toilet should be close to the play area. Playgrounds should be fenced so that children are safe inside, and they should have shaded areas and numerous accessible resting spaces (d), both for parents and for children.</span>
						</span>

						</span>
					</li>
					<li id="id_2487">
						<span>All playground equipment should be adapted for use by everyone and accessible for children with disabilities, for example by adding grab rails to a slide, raising a sandbox from ground level (e), creating a step-free, roll-in roundabout (f) or adding arm-/backrests and straps to a swing (g). Some games could be made available that are specific for children with disabilities, such as a wheelchair accessible swing (h).</span>

					<li id="id_2488">
						<span>Some playground equipment should also be used to play but also to exercise (i).</span>
